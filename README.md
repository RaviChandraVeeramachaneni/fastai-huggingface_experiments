# fastai-huggingface_experiments

This repo is created as part of the FastAI+HuggingFace study group generously organized by Weights & Biases and weight lifted by some great folks like Wayde Gilliam, Sanyam Bhutani, Zach Muller, Andrea & Morgan. 

My Learnings from each week are also posted as part of these blogposts:
<a href="https://ravichandraveeramachaneni.github.io/posts/bp7/">FastAI + HF Learnings - Week -1</a>

These experiments are my learnings from the HF documentation. Will keep this page updated with the appropriate descriptions for each notebook:

fastai+HF_week2_transformers_example.ipynb - A Basic example of a sample pipeline which consists of Tokenizing , Model & prepocessing steps.

fastai+HF_week2_Tokenizer_from_scratch.ipynb - I have tried learning about creating a Tokenizer from scratch from the HF documentation.
